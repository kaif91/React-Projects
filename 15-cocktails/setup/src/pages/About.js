      The first Shopify store was our own

      Over a decade ago, we started a store
      to sell snowboards online. None of the 
      ecommerce solutions at the time gave us 
      the control we needed to be successful
      so we built our own. Today, businesses 
      of all sizes use Shopify, whether theyâ€™re
      selling online, in retail stores, or 
      on-the-go.
